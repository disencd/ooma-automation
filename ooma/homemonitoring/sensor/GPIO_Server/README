Things to do once:

- type "make install"
- edit /boot/uEnv.txt, comment out any "cape_enable" lines
- type "systemctl disable bluetooth"
- type "systemctl disable alsa-utils"
- edit /etc/pulse/client.conf
	- change "; autospawn = yes" to "autospawn = no"
	- change "; daemon-binary = /usr/bin/pulseaudio" to "daemon-binary = /bin/true"
- type "mv /usr/bin/pulseaudio /usr/bin/pulseaudio.off"



reboot


Things to do every time you boot:

- execute "sh run" - if you get errors send Paul the output from the 'dmesg' command

Testing cape hardware:

- build a test-fixture for the test-fixture on a 6-pin pin socket with leds and resistors from the common pin 1 (VCC) to the 3 pins numbers 3, 4 and 5 (corresponding to output's 0, 1 and 2 resp)

- run "gpioserver -t" that will sequence thru all 15 output pins 

- put the fixture on all 5 output pin headers (pin one is the one closest to the end of the cape)
